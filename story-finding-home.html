          The first English word I learned outside of school was “sorry.”
          People said it on the bus, at the supermarket, when our bags
          brushed for half a second. It felt soft in my mouth, like a
          cushion placed over something sharp.
        </p>
        <p>
          At home, my mother’s Arabic was a river — fast, full, crashing into
          itself. When we moved, it turned into a small stream in our kitchen,
          running only in the evenings when the windows were closed.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a while I stopped speaking much at all. At school, my accent made
          people ask questions I didn’t want to answer. On the phone with
          family, my new silences made my aunties repeat “Are you there, habibti?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Things shifted slowly. A teacher who learned to pronounce my name
          properly. A friend who asked how to say “good morning” in Arabic and
          actually remembered. The first time someone mispronounced my name
          kindly and waited for me to correct them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I still don’t feel fully at home in any language. But I’ve started to
          enjoy the in-between space — the way my voice changes when I switch,
          the secret jokes that only work in one tongue. Home is no longer a
          single word. It’s the way I stitch them together.
